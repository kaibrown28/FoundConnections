### Technologies used 
I used a the Bulma CSS framework to style my app. I used Express.js, mongoose, mongo and Javascript for the backend.

### Approach 
I took wireframing seriously and built out a sitemap and general webpage structure. I focused on getting the scheduling service up first, because I thought it would be harder (it wasn't). I used partials and routers due to the amount of pages and routes I wanted to use. I waited until that last day or so to start styling with Bulma, which was a mistake in hindsight.

### Unsolved Problems 
I cannot get my shopping items to post to a cart page.
Inconsistent or bad styling, missing margins, padding, good spacing, etc. 
### User Stories 

### Notes to Self 
Give yourself more time to do styling.
Commit to a neater file-structure.
