##Website: Missing Connections

Problem: Throughout time and many moves, I can’t find cords for my older consoles
App – a website that allows me to buy connection cables for older consoles
Who would use it: Gaming console owners

This would be the website for an established chain of stores. There are several physical stores in the US where you can bring your system in, buy the cables needed and test it on in-store televisions. (Maybe console repair on-premises?)

##User Stories:

User 1: “I’ve inherited a Nintendo 64 from my cousin. It’s been in the attic for years, and the power cable is lost. I need to find a replacement.”

User 2: “I bought a PS1 on eBay but I was given a bum AV cable. The seller is not responsive and I don’t want to return it, so I’ll source the cable elsewhere. I need a new one to play OG Final Fantasy.”

User 3: “I found an old GameCube in the back of my closet. It works great, but my dog chewed through the display cord and my younger cousin broke my old tv by throwing the remote at the screen. Since I need to update my tv, I’ll need a new display cable with an HDMI adapter, as my new tv won’t have the inputs required.”

User 4: “I need to purchase new cables for my PS2. I want to test on one of the in-store TVs, so I need to choose my local store, submit an appointment form, and receive a confirmation on the page that my appointment was scheduled.
